# Capstone Product Plan
The second deliverable for the capstone is your product plan.

## Product Plan Components
 __Personal Learning Goals__: 
 - Learn how to integrate email with an app.
 - Learn python
 - Learn Flask as a microframework
 - Testing with Selenium?

 __Problem Statement__: 
Problem: A food bank in north Seattle requires too much repeated management work from the people who run it.

Solution: An app that can automate some of the repetative work.  It would send out automated emails (and possibly text messages), have a place for volunteers to look up procedures, and a place for volunteers to leave notes following each session.  

 __Market Research__: Outline the key insights from your research, including:
    (- your application’s competition - what alternatives are already out there (competing apps and/or non-app solutions))
    Competition: Gmail (with Boomerang), Yahoo, FoodBank
    (- research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem.)
    Research: Gmail is currently being used.  One reason it does not effectively address the problem is because it doesn't have automated emails without any add-ons.  In addition, while it does store emails effectively and they can be separated into groups, the emails are not automatically grouped based on content and often require repeated copying and pasting of both messages and contacts. 
    (- differentiation: what makes your idea/product different)
    Differentiation: This app is tailored specific to the needs of those who run this foodbank.  The goal is to focus on the tasks the currently could be easiest to automate and therefore save the volunteers time.  In addition, the goal is to create a product that will grow over time including the ability to track data and use the data to more efficiently and effectively help the food bank serve the needs of their customers.
    
 __User Personas__: (A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics? How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?) The user group focuses on two leaders and a team of around 25 volunteers.  Their key necessary characteristics are busy schedules and a desire to do more to help in their community.  These key characteristics factor into the app because it is necessary that the app both reduces the amount of time they need to spend on the tasks that are less interesting to them so they can focus on serving in the ways they love as well as it needs to be inuitive and easy to use. This app will not be a success if it requires too much work on the part of the user or is confusing to use. 

 __Trello Board__:
    - Flesh out the feature set that you created in the conceptual delivery to get started with your Trello board
  
 __Technology selections__:
    - Front-end: jQuery, Javascript, Bootstrap, (CSS, HTML)
    - Back-end: Python, Flask, Gmail API
    - Deployment: AWS
  
 __Wireframes__:
    - Any format you may like - photos of paper, online tool and/or paper to show your instructors
